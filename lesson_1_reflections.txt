How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
 was introduced?

 It could be seen easily

 How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
 efficient programmer in the long term?

 It could help us track the changes that were done

 What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create 
 a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like 
 Google Docs does?

 Lesser number of history files and so tracking is easier

 Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
  files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file 
  separately?

 Makes it easier to save and keep track of files that have changed for one 
 functionality that spans different files.

 How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of 
 files?
 git log can be used to see the commits that have happened in the repository
 and git diff can be used to see the differences in the 2 commits

 How might using version control make you more confident to make changes
  that could break something?
This is because version control gives us the ability to revert the changes to
the state it was before the error occured.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
For making modifications to my applications and to keep track of them.
